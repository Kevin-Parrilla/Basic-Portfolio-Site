# Basic-Portfolio-Site
This is my first project ever. It's a simple two-page portfolio site.

On the home page, you will see a concise about me section and a section with a photo of myself
with some links to different platforms where I share my journey on becoming a software engineer.

On the projects page, you can view two projects of my choice along with buttons to view source code, a tutorial, or a preview if it's live.

You can navigate from page to page using the navigation bar.
